## Jupyter Notebook basics

**Jupyter Notebooks have 2 modes :**
1. Command Mode
2. Edit Mode

**To switch between the modes :** 
- `Esc` : switch to command mode
- `Enter` : switch to edit mode

**Command Mode shortcuts :** 
- `↑` / `↓` arrows: Navigate up and down
- `a` / `b`: Create a cell above (`a`) or below (`b`) the current cell
- `m` / `y`: Change the cell type to Markdown (`m`) or code (`y`)
- `Shift + ↑` or `Shift + ↓`: Select multiple cells
- `Shift + m`: Merge cells
- `x` / `c` / `v`: Cut (`x`), copy (`c`), or paste (`v`) cells
- `s`: Save the notebook
  - JupyterLab: Cmd+s (Mac), Ctrl+s (Windows)
- `x`: delete a cell (or `dd`)
- `z`: Undo cell deletion
- `o`: Toggle between hiding and showing the output for selected code cells

**Either Mode:**
`Ctrl + ⏎`: Run the selected cell
`Shift + ⏎`: Run the selected cell and move to the cell below
`Alt + ⏎`:  run the selected cell and add a new cell below it

## TensorFlow vs PyTorch

- These are the 2 most popular ML libraries 
- Keras is not a full Library, it is more like a nice wrapper around these libs. It provides a little more convince when working with these ML libraries.
- Nowadays, Keras comes built in TensorFlow
